I am actively seeking Research Assistant (RA) and Ph.D. positions for Fall 2026!

I am a third-year undergraduate student in the joint-degree program between the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and the University of Glasgow (UoG), majoring in Electronic Information Engineering.

My research interests are primarily in Next-Generation Wireless Communications (Next-G), Physic-informed nerual network,Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am particularly passionate about Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), AI-driven signal processing, and the application of diffusion models in image generation and localization tasks.

I am very fortunate to be advised by the following professors on my research journey:

Prof. [Weidong Mei](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/meiweidong/zh_CN/index.htm)  & Prof. Zhi Chen, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, UESTC

Prof. [Ruxiang Xu](https://www.med.uestc.edu.cn/info/1310/2343.htm), School of Medicine, UESTC

Prof. [Haijian Sun](https://esi.uga.edu/), University of Georiga



Research Experience
======


RF-3DGS: Wireless Channel Modeling

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. Haijian Sun (University of Georgia) | May 2025 - Present

This research proposes a novel strategy to represent the Radio Frequency Field (RRF) by integrating visual and radio data, aiming to overcome the limitations of using only wireless samples.

The proposed active selection mechanism is shown to benefit Gaussian Splatting (GS) models in both sparse- and dense-view regimes.

5G-Advanced Technology Research

Research Assistant | Advisors: Prof. Weidong Mei, Prof. Zhi Chen (UESTC) | Mar 2024 - Present

Conducted the first modeling of an all-active intelligent reflecting surfaces (AIRS)-assisted wireless network.

Validated theoretical findings through numerical simulations, comparing and demonstrating the performance advantages of AIRS over passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (PIRS) in certain scenarios.

Designed an IRS-user association algorithm for the downlink communication in a multi-IRS aided wireless network, which approximates the optimal solution with polynomial complexity.

Deep Learning Deployment on Brain-Computer Interface

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. Ruxiang Xu (UESTC) | Aug 2023 - Jun 2024

Proposed DiffuCell, the first diffusion model applied to cell localization, addressing issues of background noise interference and density loss in traditional density map regression methods, significantly improving the accuracy of cell localization and counting.

Designed the Attention Map Guidance (AG) mechanism, solving the challenge of generating high-quality samples without external guidance in diffusion models, further enhancing the quality of density map generation and localization precision.

Introduced a cell map fusion strategy to address the stochastic nature of diffusion model outputs by fusing multiple density maps, producing more complete localization results and achieving 93.6% precision.
